# accelerometer_rnn_explorations

This repository contains code related to my personal explorations of LSTM RNN's using Keras (TensorFlow backend) for the classification of daily motor activities from accelerometer data. 
The data is obtained from wearable accelerometer devices. This type of research is often referred to as Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Other machine learning methods have been shown to be quite effective, and serve as benchmarks for the RNN performance.
